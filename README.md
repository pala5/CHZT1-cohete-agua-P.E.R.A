with plastic bottles, we also have included few electronical devices to record the flight data and with the aid of actuators,
electro-mechanical devices, we activate the security system landing, parachute  system.
In the following links you will find the material's list, the P.E.R.A iniciative purpose and the webpage of "RaketfuedRockets", whom have developed many water rockets and they have an excellent construction guide, step by step.
